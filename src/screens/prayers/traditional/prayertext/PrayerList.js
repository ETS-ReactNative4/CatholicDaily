        DivinMercy:'1. Make the Sign of the Cross\nIn the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.\n2. Optional Opening Prayers\nSt. Faustina’s Prayer for Sinners\O Jesus, eternal Truth, our Life, I call upon You and I beg Your mercy for poor sinners. O sweetest Heart of my Lord, full of pity and unfathomable mercy, I plead with You for poor sinners.\n O Most Sacred Heart, Fount of Mercy from which gush forth rays of inconceivable graces upon the entire human race, I beg of You light for poor sinners. O Jesus, be mindful of Your own bitter Passion and do not permit the loss of souls redeemed at so dear a price of Your most precious Blood. O Jesus, when I consider the great price of Your Blood, I rejoice at its immensity, for one drop alone would have been enough for the salvation of all sinners. Although sin is an abyss of wickedness and ingratitude, the price paid for us can never be equalled. Therefore, let every soul trust in the Passion of the Lord, and place its hope in His mercy. God will not deny His mercy to anyone. Heaven and earth may change, but Gods mercy will never be exhausted. Oh, what immense joy burns in my heart when I contemplate Your incomprehensible goodness, O Jesus! I desire to bring all sinners to Your feet that they may glorify Your mercy throughout endless ages.\nYou expired, Jesus, but the source of life gushed forth for souls, and the ocean of mercy opened up for the whole world. O Fount of Life, unfathomable Divine Mercy, envelop the whole world and empty Yourself out upon us.\n(Repeat three times)\nO Blood and Water, which gushed forth from the Heart of Jesus as a fount of mercy for us, I trust in You!\n3. Our Father\nOur Father, Who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name; Thy kingdom come; Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread; and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us; and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil, Amen.\n4. Hail Mary\nHail Mary, full of grace. The Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou amongst women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death, Amen.\n5. The Apostles’ Creed\nI believe in God, the Father almighty, Creator of heaven and earth, and in Jesus Christ, His only Son, our Lord, who was conceived by the Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died and was buried; He descended into hell; on the third day He rose again from the dead; He ascended into heaven, and is seated at the right hand of God the Father almighty; from there He will come to judge the living and the dead. I believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy catholic Church, the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and life everlasting. Amen.\n6. The Eternal Father\nEternal Father, I offer you the Body and Blood, Soul and Divinity of Your Dearly Beloved Son, Our Lord, Jesus Christ, in atonement for our sins and those of the whole world.\n7. On the 10 Small Beads of Each Decade\nFor the sake of His sorrowful Passion, have mercy on us and on the whole world.\n8. Repeat for the remaining decades\nSaying the "Eternal Father" (6) on the "Our Father" bead and then 10 "For the sake of His sorrowful Passion" (7) on the following "Hail Mary" beads.\n9. Conclude with Holy God (Repeat three times)\nHoly God, Holy Mighty One, Holy Immortal One, have mercy on us and on the whole world.\n10. Optional Closing Prayers\nEternal God, in whom mercy is endless and the treasury of compassion — inexhaustible, look kindly upon us and increase Your mercy in us, that in difficult moments we might not despair nor become despondent, but with great confidence submit ourselves to Your holy will, which is Love and Mercy itself.\nO Greatly Merciful God, Infinite Goodness, today all mankind calls out from the abyss of its misery to Your mercy — to Your compassion, O God; and it is with its mighty voice of misery that it cries out. Gracious God, do not reject the prayer of this earths exiles! O Lord, Goodness beyond our understanding, Who are acquainted with our misery through and through, and know that by our own power we cannot ascend to You, we implore You: anticipate us with Your grace and keep on increasing Your mercy in us, that we may faithfully do Your holy will all through our life and at deaths hour. Let the omnipotence of Your mercy shield us from the darts of our salvation’s enemies, that we may with confidence, as Your children, await Your [Son’s] final coming — that day known to You alone. And we expect to obtain everything promised by Jesus in spite of all our wretchedness. For Jesus is our Hope: through His merciful Heart, as through an open gate, we pass through to heaven (Diary, 1570).\n',
        MorningPrayer:'O Master and holy God, who are beyond our understanding: at your word, light came forth out of darkness. In your mercy, you gave us rest through night-long sleep, and raised us up to glorify your goodness and to offer our supplication to You. Now, in your own tender love, accept us who adore You and give thanks to You with all our heart. Grant us all our requests, if they lead to salvation; give us the grace of manifesting that we are children of light and day, and heirs to your eternal reward. In the abundance of your mercies, O Lord, remember all your people; all those present who pray with us; all our brethren on land, at sea, or in the air, in every place of Your domain, who call upon your love for mankind.

And they made his grave with the wicked and with a rich man in his death, although he had done no violent and there was no deceit in his mouth. Yet it was the will of the Lord to bruise him; he has put him to grief; when he makes himself an offering for sin he shall see his offspring, he shall prolong his days; the will of the lord shall prosper in his hand.\n\n Christ Speaks.\n\n I have fallen down again completely drained of strength My body cannot move. And yet my will is mine and so is yours. And so is yours. My child, this one thing is certain your body may be broken but no force on earth and none in hell can take away your will. Your will is yours.\n\n  Man Responds.\n\n My Lord, After a moment’s rest you took off again and staggered on. I can do the same because my will is mine When all my strength is gone and guilt and self-reproach press me to earth and seem to hold me fast, when I am pressed down by the consideration that I am of a fallen race protect me from the sin of Judas.

        Reading:'Reading (JOHN 19:23-24)\n\n When the soldiers had crucified Jesus, they took his garments and made four parts, one for each soldier, also his tunic. But the tunic was without seam, woven from top to bottom; so they said to one another, “Let us not tear it, but cast lots for it to see whose it shall be.” This was to fulfil the scripture, “They parted my garments among them, and for my clothing they cast lots”.\n\n Christ Speaks.\n\n Behold, the poorest king who ever lived. Before the creatures of my own hand I stand stripped. The cross — my deathbed —  is not even my own. Possessing nothing, I own all — I own my Father’s love.  You too own everything So do not worry about your food, your clothes, your life..\n\n  Man Responds.\n\n Lord, strip me of the cravings for prestige position, wealth and priviledges.

Obtain for us the grace to hate sin, even as he hated it in the agony in the garden; to endure them in the judgement hall; to be meek and humble in all our trials as he was before his judges; to love our enemies even as he loved his murderers, and prayed for them upon the cross; and to glorify God and to do good to our neighbor, even as he did in every mystery of his suffering. O queen of martyrs, who by the Dolours of thy immaculate heart on Calvary, didst merit to share the passion of thy compassion, that for the love of Jesus crucified, we may be crucified to the world in this life , and in the life to come.
